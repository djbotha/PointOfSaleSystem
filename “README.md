# PointOfSaleSystem

>“Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget Rule No. 1.” (Buffet, 2015) 

##Summary
Through the duration of this project a Point of Sale System (from here on referred to as POS) will be designed and developed to accommodate the needs of a grocery store. 
There are already multiple POS Systems, each with their own characteristics. The system that will be developed through this project will however give a broader scope of tools that is essential in running your own shop flawlessly.  

##Define The Task
For my Practical Assessment Task I will be creating a Point of Sale system, as is used in grocery stores such as Spar and Checkers. This piece of software must be able to add groceries to a list, then add the costs up, print out a slip and receive payment, and then calculate change. This system will however also be used to keep track of stock, remember how many items have been sold and notify you when stocks are near depletion. 
The user needs to be able to add items/stock to the database, to fill up stock that has been depleted. A various list of statements will be able to be generated, e.g. a total list of sales, the amount of money made in a day/week/month etc. or even how much change is left in the till.
